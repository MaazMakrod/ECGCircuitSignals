# ECGCircuitSignals
A basic MATLAB code for processing ECG signal data and creating graphs based on it. Please take a look at the README file for further information.

Within the zip folder, there are multiple functions and a main script called "MainScript" that will run these functions. The files ecg1, ecg2, and ecg3 are the ECG data for 3 different patients consisting of more than 200, 000 points.

A detailed report going over the data and graphs generated, as well as the meaning of the data and graphs can be found here:
